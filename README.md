**S**atellite-powered **P**rediction and **E**valuation of **C**yanobacterial **T**oxicity and **R**isk **A**ssessment
<br>
We aim to make our efforts in solving the effects of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABS) by creating a predictive Support Vector Machines (SVM) model. This model will enable the creation of early warning systems to alert coastal communities, aquaculture industries, and public health agencies about potential HAB events.

##Harmful Algal blooms
- HABs refer to the rapid bloom of certain types of algal species that produce toxins as it reproduces or when it dies
- They can occur in freshwater, brackish water as well as marine environments, leading to visible discoloration of water.
- Major types:
<ul>
Biome level toxic HABs: Produce harmful toxins, posing risks to human health, wildlife, and fisheries.
Ichthyic Catastrophes: Cause massive fish die-offs, through toxin exposure or oxygen depletion or by damaging their gills.
Shellfish Contamination: Contaminate shellfish with toxins, endangering human consumers.
Oxygen Depletion: Decomposition of algal biomass leads to oxygen-depleted dead zones in water!
</ul>
