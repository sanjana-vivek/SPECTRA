We aim to make our efforts in solving the effects of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABS) by creating a predictive Support Vector Machines (SVM) model. This model will enable the creation of early warning systems to alert coastal communities, aquaculture industries, and public health agencies about potential HAB events.

## Harmful Algal blooms
- HABs refer to the rapid bloom of certain types of algal species that produce toxins as it reproduces or when it dies
- They can occur in freshwater, brackish water as well as marine environments, leading to visible discoloration of water.
- Major types:
<ins>Biome level toxic HABs:</ins> Produce harmful toxins, posing risks to human health, wildlife, and fisheries.
<ins>Ichthyic Catastrophes:</ins> Cause massive fish die-offs, through toxin exposure or oxygen depletion or by damaging their gills.
<ins>Shellfish Contamination:</ins> Contaminate shellfish with toxins, endangering human consumers.
<ins>Oxygen Depletion:</ins> Decomposition of algal biomass leads to oxygen-depleted dead zones in water!
