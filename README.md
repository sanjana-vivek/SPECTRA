**S**atellite-powered **P**rediction and **E**valuation of **C**yanobacterial **T**oxicity and **R**isk **A**ssessment
<br/>

We aim to make our efforts in solving the effects of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABS) by creating a predictive Support Vector Machines (SVM) model. This model will enable the creation of early warning systems to alert coastal communities, aquaculture industries, and public health agencies about potential HAB events.
<br/>
## Harmful Algal blooms
- HABs refer to the rapid bloom of certain types of algal species that produce toxins as it reproduces or when it dies <br/>
- They can occur in freshwater, brackish water as well as marine environments, leading to visible discoloration of water.<br/>
- Major types:<br/>
<ins>Biome level toxic HABs</ins> : Produce harmful toxins, posing risks to human health, wildlife, and fisheries.<br/>
<ins>Ichthyic Catastrophes</ins> : Cause massive fish die-offs, through toxin exposure or oxygen depletion or by damaging their gills.<br/>
<ins>Shellfish Contamination</ins> : Contaminate shellfish with toxins, endangering human consumers.<br/>
<ins>Oxygen Depletion</ins> : Decomposition of algal biomass leads to oxygen-depleted dead zones in water!<br/>

There are different classes of HABS including cyanobacteria, dinoflagellate, prymensiophytes, cyptonomads, raphidophytes, diatoms and more. <br/>

According to our in-depth research and analysis we discovered that about **51% of HABs release toxins**. There are about **2175 animal ilnesses and 117 human illnessses** associated with these toxic releases making it a pressing concern and in need of our immediate attention. <br/>

## Our motive and solution idea
Our idea aims to incorporate machine learning algorithms to predict Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) in aquatic environments. <br/>
Our project further extends to creating a web interface to send early warning alerts to coastal communities, aquaculture industries and public health agencies about potential HAB events. <br/>
Using Python and its machine learning libraries such as Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, this project employs some predictive models to analyze historical data on environmental conditions, water quality parameters, and past occurrences of HABs and how they depend on geographical features,  water temperature, nutrient levels, pH etc. <br/>
Satellite imagery data will be our primary tool in the development of accurate predictive models. Our aim is to integrate space technology to address environmental challenges on Earth. <br/>
